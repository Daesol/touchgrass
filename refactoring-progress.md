# Refactoring Progress Report

## Completed

### Phase 1: Core Authentication Layer
- [x] Set up core directory structure
- [x] Created auth cookie utility `CookieManager` for safely handling Supabase auth cookies
- [x] Consolidated browser client with caching
- [x] Simplified server clients for various contexts
- [x] Created clean middleware with separation of concerns:
  - [x] Route configuration
  - [x] Auth logic
  - [x] Middleware composition

### Phase 2: Feature-based Structure
- [x] Created feature module directory structure
- [x] Implemented React hooks for data management:
  - [x] `useEvents` for managing events
  - [x] `useContacts` for managing contacts
  - [x] `useProfile` for managing user profiles
- [x] Created API handlers for all features:
  - [x] Events API
  - [x] Contacts API
  - [x] Profile API
- [x] Updated API routes to use the new handlers

### Phase 3: React Hooks
- [x] Created auth hooks that replace the context provider
- [x] Created data-specific hooks for each entity
- [x] Properly typed all hooks and their return values

### Phase 4: API Standardization
- [x] Created standard API response format
- [x] Implemented API error handling utilities
- [x] Created standard handlers for all APIs
- [x] Updated API routes to use the new handlers

## In Progress / Pending

1. **Update Import References**
   - Need to update all imports in components to use new paths
   - Need to migrate from old files to new ones in components

2. **Create Server Actions for Features**
   - Create server actions for events
   - Create server actions for contacts
   - Create server actions for profile

3. **Remove Legacy Code**
   - Remove old Supabase implementation in `lib/` directory
   - Remove SupabaseProvider context

## Benefits of the New Architecture

1. **Simplified Authentication**
   - Consistent auth handling across different contexts
   - Better cookie management with proper caching
   - Clear separation between browser and server auth

2. **Improved Feature Organization**
   - Each feature has its own directory with dedicated components, hooks, and API handlers
   - Clear boundaries between features
   - Easier to maintain and extend

3. **Standardized API Patterns**
   - Consistent API response format
   - Better error handling
   - Type-safe responses

4. **React Hook-based Data Access**
   - Simpler data access with hooks
   - No need for complex context providers
   - Better TypeScript support

5. **Middleware Improvements**
   - Simplified middleware with clear separation of concerns
   - More maintainable and testable
   - Better error handling

## Next Steps

1. Complete server actions for each feature
2. Update component imports to use the new hooks and utilities
3. Test all authentication flows and data operations
4. Remove legacy code once everything is working properly
5. Add more comprehensive error handling and loading states to the hooks
